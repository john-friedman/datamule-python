     - CertificatesOfDepositAtCarryingValue
     - A savings certificate entitling the Entity (that is, bearer) to receive interest at an established maturity date, based upon a fixed interest rate. A certificate of deposit may be issued in any denomination. Certificates of deposit are generally issued by commercial banks and, therefore, insured by the FDIC (up to the prescribed limit). Certificates of deposit generally restrict holders from withdrawing funds on demand without the incurrence of penalties. Generally, only certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less qualify as cash equivalents. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. As a related example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.

Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to: (1) significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; (2) significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee; (3) significant adverse change in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates; (4) a bona fide offer to purchase (whether solicited or unsolicited), an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar security for an amount less than the cost of the investment; or (5) factors that raise significant concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt covenants."

Original maturity means an original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.

     - TimeDepositsAtCarryingValue
     - Any certificate of deposit or savings account held by a bank or other financial institution for a short-term specified period of time. Because of their short-term, time deposits are considered highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.

     - WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesContingentlyIssuable
     - Shares issuable for little or no cash consideration upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (contingently issuable shares) are considered outstanding common shares and included in the computation of basic Earnings Per Share as of the date that all necessary conditions have been satisfied (in essence, when issuance of the shares is no longer contingent). Outstanding common shares that are contingently returnable (that is, subject to recall) are treated in the same manner as contingently issuable shares. Contingently issuable shares include shares that (a) will be issued in the future upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, (b) have been placed in escrow and all or part must be returned if specified conditions are not met, or (c) have been issued but the holder must return all or part if specified conditions are not met. The number of contingently issuable shares is determined by relating the portion of time within a reporting period that these shares have been outstanding to the total time in that period.
